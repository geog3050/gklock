Hello my name is Gretchen Klock and I am graduating this May, 2024 with a BS in Environmental Policy and Planning with a History minor and GIS certificate. I am interested in studying Chicagoland area transportation and completed an unergraduate research thesis on the topic of the cancelled Crosstown Expressway proposed in Chicago. After graduation, I will be working for Kane County, IL Department of Transportation as the Bicycle/Pedestrian planning coordinator.
